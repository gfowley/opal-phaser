# A demo of opal-phaser
This directory is a demo of opal-phaser in action (based on the tutorial here: http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game)

If you haven't yet, clone the the repository as explained in the
[README](https://github.com/salama/opal-phaser) and cd into the demo directory. Then:


```
cd demo
bundle
rackup # you may need to prepend this with `bundle exec`
```

and go to localhost:9292 (or whatever the server says)

And enjoy playing your first browser game made in ruby!
